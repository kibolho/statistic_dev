  "text": "Fine-tuning leverages transfer learning. It takes advantage of the knowledge already encoded in the parameters of a pre-trained neural network model like BERT or GPT-3. These large models have been trained on massive datasets over long periods of time to build robust general knowledge about language and the world. Fine-tuning them on a downstream task allows quickly adapting this general knowledge to a new specialized domain. Only the higher layers of the network are re-trained on the new data, leaving the largest portion of parameters fixed. This preserves the pre-existing long-term memory while allowing adaptation to new tasks. In contrast, search base methods start learning from scratch on each new dataset. There is no transfer of prior knowledge. The model starts with random or blank parameters, building up long-term knowledge on the specific training data from the ground up. This allows creating a model optimized for the dataset and task at hand. However, it disregards all prior knowledge the model could have and requires much more training data and compute to build robust representations. The choice depends on the similarity of the new task to the original pre-training objective. If they are close, fine-tuning can achieve state-of-the-art results with minimal additional training. If they are very different, search base may be better to create specialized knowledge. However, pre-trained models are becoming so generalized that fine-tuning is effective even when tasks differ significantly from pre-training. Computational costs also favor fine-tuning in most cases. But for some highly specialized domains like biomedical data, search base methods may ultimately perform better. In summary, fine-tuning efficiently adapts a foundation of general long-term knowledge, while search base builds specialized knowledge from scratch. The optimal approach depends on task similarity, data availability, compute constraints, and the need for specialized representations. There are several other main training approaches for artificial neural networks besides fine-tuning and search base: Multi-task learning: This involves training a single model on multiple related tasks at the same time. The shared layers learn representations that capture common knowledge across tasks, while higher layers specialize for each task. This creates a model with robust general knowledge that can adapt quickly to new related tasks. Transfer learning: Similar to fine-tuning, this involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new task. But some transfer learning techniques fix all the pre-trained weights and only train additional layers appended to the model for the new task. This prevents disrupting the pre-trained knowledge. Self-supervised learning: The model learns to solve an artificial proxy task from unlabeled data, which teaches it generally useful representations of the world. For example, predicting missing words from sentences. This pre-training can then be transferred to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments to evaluate its actions. This allows the model to develop specialized skills through trial-and-error experience. RL is commonly used in game-playing AIs. Meta-learning: The model 'learns to learn' - it learns common algorithms or update rules that allow quickly adapting to new tasks from small amounts of data. This makes the model generalize well from fewer examples. Life-long/continual learning: The model continuously trains on a stream of changing data over a long period of time. This mimics human learning over many years, and allows the model to incrementally expand its knowledge. The best training approach depends on the availability of various types of data, the similarity between tasks, the need for generalizability, and the constraints on re-training. Multi-modal training that combines various techniques is often optimal."
